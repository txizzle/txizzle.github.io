                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It&#39;s been a long while since www.tedxiao.com went offline, but I guess that ends today. Why today? Somehow, I came across an interesting video that made me think for a good 30 minutes and I realized &#45; I really do have these moments where I think of some weird proof or challenging problem, and I just feel compelled to write it down and tell someone or show someone. Why not through a website? And so I&#39;m reviving the personal website! I made www.tedxiao.com with the initial goal of just having a &#39;template&#39; website to teach me some front-end (I never made it past pretty rudimentary HTML and CSS) and having a place to slap my projects onto. Hopefully <a href="www.tedxiao.me">www.tedxiao.me</a> will be able to but also be a medium for me to nerd out occasionally and just post cool stuff. Without further ado, the problem I was ruminating about today! The video was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVPCT1VjySA">problem</a> involving Santa Claus, 1024 wrapped gifts (with one slightly heavier), and a balance. <a href="santasearch.pdf">Here</a> is a quick writeup I made about the problem and my solution. Enjoy!
